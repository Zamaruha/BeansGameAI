# BeansGameAI

This project is dedicated to a development of an AI for a Beans Game. <br />
Rules could be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Bohnenspiel. <br />
The game could be observed here: http://bohnenspiel.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/start/games. <br />

My AI uses Minmax algorithm with Alpha-Beta-Prunning and goes 14 levels deep. <br />
To play against my AI run main method in src/main/GameClient.java and follow the instructions from the console. <br />
**Test your might!**
